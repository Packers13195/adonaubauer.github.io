# CS499 Capstone Class Overview
The capstone class is the end of the Bachelor of Science - Computer Science degree program and the culmination of my learning journey in it. 
The importance of this class is to become prepared to enter the real-world workforce as an IT professional. This began with developing the plan for the course, developing a plan in line with the course areas and outcomes.

## Course Areas

| Software Engineering and Design |
| Algorithms and Structures |
| Databases |

## Course Outcomes

| 1.	Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science |
| 2.	Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. |
| 3.	Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. |
| 4.	Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. |
| 5.	Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. |

These course areas and outcomes are met by creating three enhancements to a previous project or projects created throughout the program. The student develops a plan and then their professor approves the plan. It is a big change for many students because in the previous courses of the program have the course content outlined already and the student needs to work through the content. This capstone class is the opposite and requires the student to plan the content of the course and then develop and document it.

# My enhancement plan
For the first enhancement, I plan to use my previous experience and knowledge of mobile app development to complete this area. I had developed a simple android application in the previous course CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. The app was a simple android app, and my plan was to expand on it and redevelop it using the Flutter Framework so that I could develop the app for other platforms. This demonstrates my skills and abilities in programming and utilizing an industry standard tool like the Flutter Framework. This plan also completes a few of the course outcomes like demonstrating that industry standard tool and designing and developing professional quality oral written and visual communications.

For the second enhancement, I plan to also use the mobile app artifact because I thought I could enhance it again in a different way. The inventory app utilizes the item database to display the items to a user, but a user is not able to search, sort, or filter these items in any way. I could complete the Algorithms and Structures area by adding the search, sorting, and filtering features to my app. This would also complete the outcome of using computing solutions to solve a problem with algorithmic principles. The algorithmic principles would be used for searching and sorting items in the app.

For the third enhancement, I plan to update the database used in the Inventory app. I will use the same artifact because it was developed initially using a SQLite local database. I saw this as a great opportunity to update the app to use the cloud-based database Firebase and enhance the app this way. Firebase is an industry standard and has more capabilities than the local SQLite database. This enhancement shows off my knowledge of databases and data structures. It completes course outcome for utilizing industry standard tool and also keeps security in mind to complete that outcome. 

All three of these enhancements also fulfill outcome one to create collaboration in the project. I improved my comments and documentation of the project throughout the development and using GitHub allows myself and others to work on the project.
