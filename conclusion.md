# Conclusion

Even though this may be the end and completion of the degree program, this is not the end of my educational journey. Through the program we have learned about the field of computer science and how much and fast it changes around us. This is an important lesson that I understand and hope I continue to learn and grow as I join the industry. I reflect back on all I have learned over the last three years, and I am proud to say I learned a lot and look forward to using my skills. But I will not take graduating as the end of my journey because this is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will continue to hone my skills and learn new ones, so please check back on my portfolio and follow my journey.
