# Conclusion

Even though this may be the end and completion of the degree program, this is not the end of my educational journey. Through the program I have learned how much and how fast the field of computer science changes. This is an important lesson and I look forward to continuing to learn and grow as I join the industry. I reflect back on all I have learned over the last three years, and I am proud of my accomplishments and look forward to using my skills. But I do not view graduating as the end of my journey because this is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will continue to hone my skills and develop new ones, so please check back on my portfolio and follow my journey.
