# Introduction
Hello, my name is Austin Donaubauer. I am an aspiring software engineer and am excited to share my journey with you all. 
My journey started way back in 2013 after graduating from Watertown High School in Wisconsin, I decided to pursue an associate degree in Mobile Application Development with emphasis in Android Development at Madison Area Technical College. Growing up I was around a lot of technology whether that be a personal computer or laptop, or even video game systems like a PlayStation 2 or a game boy advanced, and this fueled my curiosity in learning about programming. I took some basic programming courses in High School and decided mobile applications would be a cool thing to learn about.

It was an interesting journey as it did take a few years to complete the program. I graduated in 2017 with my degree, but unfortunately, I was not able to find a position in this field. Fast forward a few years to 2019 and I found a job in a call center for the company Pitney Bowes. This was my first opportunity to be in the IT industry, and I could hopefully launch my career. Over the last few years, I remained at Pitney Bowes and was promoted to a tier 3 support agent. I learned a lot about customer service and how software solves problems for them as I worked with customers to resolve issues and questions. I have been able to work closely with the product analysts and software engineers who accepted escalations from me on behalf of the customer when something wasn't resolvable by me. 

In June 2023, I decided to use the tuition assistance offered by Pitney Bowes and research college programs in the IT field. I decided that online schooling was going to be a good option for me so that I could continue to work normally and then work on school after work without missing time for in person classes. I found Southern New Hampshire University's Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with emphasis in software engineering to be a good fit for me. My ambition has continued to grow, and I want to be a professional software engineer. I learned a lot throughout the program and the main idea I learned is that there are several other responsibilities of a software engineer other than coding. It is important to understand that software engineers can be well rounded team members, where they can be a project leader, developer, tester, or analyst. I am looking for the right opportunity to begin my career as an IT professional.
