# Introduction
Hello, my name is Austin Donaubauer. I am an aspiring software engineer and am excited to share my journey with you all. 
After graduating from Watertown High School in Wisconsin, I decided to pursue an associate degree in Mobile Application Development with emphasis in Android Development at Madison Area Technical College. Growing up I was around a lot of technology whether that be a personal computer or laptop, or even video game systems like a PlayStation 2 or a game boy advanced, and this fueled my curiosity in learning about programming. I took some basic programming courses in High School and decided mobile applications would be a cool thing to learn about.

I graduated in 2017 with my degree, but unfortunately, I was not able to find a position in this field. Fast forward a few years to 2019 when I accepted a position in a call center for the company Pitney Bowes. This was my first opportunity in the IT industry, and and a launching point for my career. Over the last few years, I remained at Pitney Bowes and was promoted to a tier 3 support agent. I learned a lot about customer service and how software solves problems for them as I worked with clients to resolve issues and questions. I have been able to work closely with the product analysts and software engineers who accepted escalations from me on behalf of the customer when something wasn't resolvable by me. 

In June 2023, I decided to use the tuition assistance offered by Pitney Bowes and research college programs in the IT field. I decided that online schooling was a good option so that I could continue to work full-time during the day and focus on my coursework in the evenings. I found Southern New Hampshire University's Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with emphasis in software engineering. The program has been a good fit for me, and solidified my commitment to be a professional software engineer. The program taught me that there are several responsibilities of a software engineer other than coding. Software engineers should be well rounded team members, able to fill the role of project leader, developer, tester, or analyst, which was emphasized over the program. I am looking for the right opportunity to begin my career as an IT professional.
