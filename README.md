# Code Review
I performed a personal video code review of the original artifact and functionality of the Inventory App I developed in the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. The inventory app is a simple android app that allows users to login, create a login, add, edit, and delete items, and view items. 
I reviewed the java and xml code in the project, and discussed my planned enhancements for my capstone project for CS499 Capstone class.
