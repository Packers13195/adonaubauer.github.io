# Austin Donaubauer's ePortfolio

# Introduction
Hello, my name is Austin Donaubauer. I am an aspiring software engineer and am excited to share my journey with you all. 
My journey started way back in 2013 after graduating from Watertown High School in Wisconsin, I decided to pursue an Associate Degree in Mobile Application Development with emphasis in Android Development at Madison Area Technical College. Growing up I was around a lot of technology whether that be a personal computer or laptop, or even video game systems like a playstation 2 or a game boy advanced, and this fueled my curiousity in learning about programming. I took some basic programming courses in High School and decided mobile applications would be a cool thing to learn about. 
It was an interesting journey as it did take a few years to complete the program. I graduated in 2017 with my degree, but unfortunately I was not able to find a position in this field. Fast forward a few years to 2019 and I found a job in a call center for the company Pitney Bowes. This was my first opportunity to be in the IT industry and I could hopefully launch my career. Over the last few years I remained at Pitney Bowes but was able to move up to become a tier 3 support agent. I learned a lot about customer service and how software solves problems for them as I worked with customers to resolve issues and questions they had about the software. I also have been able to work closely with the product analysts and software engineers who accepted escalations from me on behalf of the customer when something wasn't resolvable by me. 
In June 2023, I finally decided to take advantage of the tuition assistance offered by Pitney Bowes and research colleges and programs in the IT field. I decided that online schooling was going to be a good option for me so that I could continue to work normally and then work on school after work without missing time for in person classes. I landed on Southern New Hampshire University's Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with emphasis in software engineering. My ambition has continued to grow and I want to become a software engineer. I learned a lot throughout the program and I believe there are several other responsibilities of a software engineering other than coding being the main focus. Its important to understand that software engineers can be well rounded team members, where they can be the project leader, or the developer, or the tester, or even the analyst. I just need to find that right opportunity to begin my career and I look forward my future.

# CS499 Capstone Class Overview
The capstone class is the end of the Bachelor's of Science - Computer Science degree program. 
The importance of this class is to become prepared to enter the real world workforce as a IT professional. This began with developing the plan for the course as the course requires the student to outline a plan in line with the provided course areas and course outcomes.

# Course Areas
| Software Engineering and Design |
| Algorithms and Structures |
| Databases |

# Course Outcomes
| 1.	Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science |
| 2.	Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. |
| 3.	Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. |
| 4.	Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. |
| 5.	Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. |

These course areas and course outcomes are suppose to be met with three enhancements to previous projects created through out the program. The student develops a plan and works with their professor to approve a plan to that fulfills this. Its a big change for many students since previous courses have the course content outlined already and the student just needs to work through the content. This capstone class is the opposite and requires the student to plan the content of the course, and then develop and document it.

# My enhancement plan
For my first enhancement I planned to use my previous experience and knowledge of mobile app development to complete this area. I had developed a simple android application in the previous course CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. The app was a simple android app, and my plan was to expand on it and redevelop it using the Flutter Framework so that I could develop the app for other platforms. This demonstrates my skills and abilities in programming and utilizing an industry standard tool like the Flutter Framework. This plan also completes a few of the course outcomes like demonstrating that industry standard tool, and designing and developing professional quality oral written and visual communincations.

For my second enhancement I planned to also use the mobile app artifact because I thought I could enhance it again in a different way. The inventory app utilizes the item database to display the items to a user, but a user is not able to search, sort, or filter these items in any way. I could complete the Algorithms and Structures area by adding the search, sorting, and filtering feature to my app. This would also complete the outcome to use computing solutions to solve a problem with algorithmic principles. The algorithmic principles would be used for searching and sorting items in the app.

For the third enhancement I planned to update the database used in the Inventory app. I again used the same artifact because it was developed initially using the SQLite local database. I saw this as a great opportunity to update the app to use the cloud based database Firebase and enhance the app this way. Firebase is an industry standard and also has more capabilities than the local SQLite database that can enhance the experience. This enhancement shows off my knowledge of databases and data. It completes course outcome for utilizing industry standard tool and also keeps security in mind to complete that outcome. 

All three of these enhancements also fulfill outcome one to create collaboration in the project. I improved my comments and documentation of the project through out the development and using GitHub allows for myself and others to work on the project.

# Code Review
I performed a personal video code review of the original artifact and functionality of the Inventory App I developed in the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. The inventory app is a simple android app that allows users to login, create a login, add, edit, and delete items, and view items. 
I reviewed the java and xml code in the project, and discussed my planned enhancements for my capstone project for CS499 Capstone class.

# Enhancement One Details and Reflection
The artifact I selected after reviewing several projects across my educational journey was the Inventory Warehouse app which I developed in the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course at Southern New Hampshire University. The app was a simple android app that allows the user to register an account, login with that account, then view inventory items, edit or delete those items, add items to a SQLite database, and it included a push notification to alert users to low quantity items. I chose this artifact due to my history and knowledge of mobile applications from my associate degree program that I completed. I am most confident in my skills and abilities in this area of computer science and felt most confident in showing this project and the enhancement of it in my ePortolio. Since the original artifact was written in java and xml, the enhancement I planned was to use the Flutter framework and redevelop the artifact in dart language. I believe this shows my skills in mobile application development and understanding how to utilize the Flutter framework to create a cross platform app that can be run on both android and iOS. Flutter is an industry standard tool that I hope to use more in both my continuing education and in a professional setting. I made minor changes throughout development when compared to the original artifact such as changes to the home screen buttons and bottom navigation buttons. I also think I improved the UI of the inventory screen to display the items a bit differently. Lastly I improved the validation of both the add item screen and the user registration forms, and added hashing to the password so the raw password is no longer saved in the database for more security. I am still working to include the push notifications as I have not implemented that, and I still would like to include that as a feature. I was able to complete the planned outcome about designing and developing a solution to solve a problem, as not with the redevelopment of the app in Flutter it has become a cross platform app that can run on both android and iOS. I think this also completed a few other outcomes like the security outcome since I was able to implement better form validation and hashing the password. Another outcome it covers is the use of an industry standard tool like Flutter. I enjoyed the process of revisiting the original artifact and was able to work through each element to implement them in Flutter. I made small changes compared to the original which I feel makes the new app more secure such as hashing the password instead of saving the raw password. Other changes along the way were minor changes to the UI like improving the inventory screen layout to display the items. Since dart is a new language to me, I had to review a lot more documentation on the different libraries that I used, and I am still learning about all the different options which I am excited to continue learning. In enhancement two and enhancement three I will be working with this same artifact in the flutter framework and get to learn some more UI elements and logic to implement the search and sort feature, and use Firebase for the database instead of SQLite. I was also happy to be able to use Git and GitHub to commit the changes and updates throughout the development. A few challenges I hit was some issues with Git and GitHub and making sure I was working on the right branches. Another challenge I hit at the end is when using Android Studio IDE I ran into a gradle error where the project was not syncing which meant I could not run the application. But overall this enhancement development was a great start and I look forward to further developing this enhancement to polish it for my ePortfolio.
